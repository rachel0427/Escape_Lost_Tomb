## About the Puzzles (Spoilers Alert)
### Room 1

This is the room where the game starts in. The room is very dark with unlit torches on each wall. There is a table with a candle and a green diamond on top, 2 boxes, and a coffin in the room. 
The players can pick up a candle from the table to give them better vision. Using the candle, players can lit up one of the boxes, revealing a key inside. The key allows the player to unlock the door and enter the second room. When the player approach the coffin, the coffin lid opens and reveals a note that gives a player a hint to the final puzzle.

### Room 2

In the second room, the player will find a puzzle on the wall. This is a Chinese Zodiac Puzzle that requires the player to calculate the zodiac year, and open the door by selecting the correct animal figurines on the table. 

### Room 3

In this room, there are no visible doors on the walls. In the middle of the room is a skull and multiple stands that players can place the skulls on. The player need to place the skull on the correct stand for an exit to manifest. To determine the correct stand, if the player walks around the room and pay close attention to the audio, they will find a wall that continuously whispers "get out". The stand closest to that wall is the correct solution. Different colored light effects will indicate whether the player is correct (green light) or incorrect (red light).

### Room 4

 The final room is empty except for a pot in the center, emitting green smoke. To solve the puzzle in this room, the player will need the clue they obtained from the first room, which is an indication that they need to collect 3 gems of different colors. The player need to bring to the pot a green emerald from Room 1, a red ruby from Room 2, and a yellow gem from Room 3. Then the player needs to put all three stones into the pot, revealing a key that opens the door to the outside corridor.

 In the corridor, the player will find themselves being chased by a Terra-Cotta Warrior. The player will need to keep running down the corridor until they reach the final exit, leading them into a bright and beautiful outside world!
